in powershell match returns an array of matched results 
foreach is needed to iterate over the array

foreach {[regex]::match($_,'(?<=FullName=).*?(?=})').value}

replace only returns the the replaced string. note that regex is supported


cat file.txt | % {$_ -replace "find", "replace"}

When using Back Referencing with powershell regex you need to escape the dollar sign ($) by adding backtick(`) before it 

you can pipe the replace method into another replace method just like you can pipe sed into another sed

| % {$_ -replace "C:\\", "file:///C:/"} | % {$_ -replace "\\", "/"}

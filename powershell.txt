run a program pased on a path

& "the path"   (the path must be inside"")

execute powershell command without showing the console. any long command that uses pipes is a no go

PowerShell.exe -WindowStyle hidden { powershell command }


kill process based on the name

Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*something*"} | Stop-Process

OR

Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*something*"} | Stop-Process -Force -processname {$_.ProcessName}



Execute powershell script. outside the powershell console

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1


Pause script execution for a specific amount of time

Start-Sleep -s time in seconds



you use [Where-Object] when you want to filter objects from all the available objects

you use [Select-Object] when you want to get a certain property or properties from all the available objects

you use [ForEach-Object] when you want to do something to every single object for example add or subtract from each object. Or getting the value from every object


powershell regex

.\adb.exe shell am broadcast -a clipper.get | foreach {[regex]::match($_,'(?<=data=").*(?="$)').value}     (Any line that does not match the regex will exist as an empty line in the output)


$String = .\adb.exe shell am broadcast -a clipper.get
[regex]::matches($String, '(?<=data=").*(?="$)').Value         (The slightly longer version does not have the issue of the shorter version)

When using Back Referencing with powershell regex you need to escape the dollar sign ($) by adding backtick(`) before it 

in powershell match returns an array of matched results 
foreach is needed to iterate over the array

foreach {[regex]::match($_,'(?<=FullName=).*?(?=})').value}

replace only returns the the replaced string. note that regex is supported


cat file.txt | % {$_ -replace "find", "replace"}

you can pipe the replace method into another replace method just like you can pipe sed into another sed

| % {$_ -replace "C:\\", "file:///C:/"} | % {$_ -replace "\\", "/"}



merge html files

fast
$newfile=""; for($i=1; $i -le 70; $i++) {$newfile += GC "$i.html"} $newfile | out-file "target.html"

slow
for($i=1; $i -le 70; $i++){Get-Content "$i.html" >> joinedFile.html}


Copy file to every folder and subfolder
Get-ChildItem C:\DestinationFolder\ -Directory -Recurse | Copy-Item "C:\Filetocopy\123.csv" -Destination {$_.fullname}

hash files recursively

Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 | Select Hash,Path | % {$_ -replace "(\w.*? )(.+)(\\)(.*)", "`$1`$4"} | % {$_ -replace "@.*?=", ""} | % {$_ -replace "}", ""} | % {$_ -replace ";", ""}

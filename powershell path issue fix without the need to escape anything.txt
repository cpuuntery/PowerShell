If you have any issue with the file path, just replace the parameter -Path with  -LiteralPath 

the reason why because 

-Path always treats its input as a wildcard pattern.

-LiteralPath turns off wildcard expansion and passes the string directly to the filesystem.

Any [ or ] in your path no longer triggers a WildcardPatternException.
